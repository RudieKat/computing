# Once upon a time

You might know nothing about computers and programming. Or you might now everything ever about generics and lambda expressions and map/reduce.

But do could you build a stack from scratch? Do you know what happens in the most simplistic representation of a CPU? And is it useful? I think it is.

So over the next week or so I will add a lot of information and finally a rudimentary IDE for you to play around with if you want. There is an art to understanding how to work in a restrictive environment that is useful even under normal circumstances.

I hope you will gain something from it at least
