<h1 id="i-have-this-theory">I have this theory</h1>
<p>I have worked with computers for a very long time and let me first say that it’s a much more pleasant experience today than it ever was. But not all things are necessarily helpful because they are pleasant. Sometimes you need a challenge in order to learn how to do certain things.</p>
<p>Most people today never have to touch the bare metal and that has a lot of benefits but it also means that they never really have to thing about the limitations and the risks. And they miss out on a lot of the frustrating fun of it. Coding in low level languages is the Dark Souls of programming. Fair but everything can and will kill you. I think that actually has some merit and value.</p>
<p>So a while back I decided to sit down and design this absolutely minimal fake CPU with a very small instruction set as a teaching tool. It has a sort of assembly like language associated with it that is linked and runs in an emulator of sorts. Eventually it will turn up here but we have some way to go first. And since this isn’t just for software developers I warn you there will be some duh obvious moments. But relax, it will get better.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it. I did.</p>
