<p>I have worked with computers for a very long time and let me first say that it’s a much more pleasant experience today than it ever was. But not all things are necessarily helpful because they are pleasant. Sometimes you need a challenge in order to learn how to do certain things.</p>
<p>Most people today never have to touch the bare metal and that has a lot of benefits but it also means that they never really have to thing about the limitations and the risks. And they miss out on a lot of the frustrating fun of it. Coding in low level languages is the Dark Souls of programming. Fair but everything can and will kill you. I think that actually has some merit and value.</p>
<p>So a while back I decided to sit down and design this absolutely minimal fake CPU with a very small instruction set as a teaching tool. It has a sort of assembly like language associated with it that is linked and runs in an emulator of sorts. Eventually it will turn up here but we have some way to go first. And since this isn’t just for software developers I warn you there will be some duh obvious moments. But relax, it will get better.</p>
<p>Note: most assembly languages you see tend to have multiple registers. Typically you might see an instruction like</p>
<pre><code>mov sp,r0
</code></pre>
<p>My example is a much, MUCH simpler CPU design which doesn’t have the luxury of having these instructions at the outset but it you follow along you will find that there is no real difference.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it. I did.<br>
When you want  to test some code the emulator with all sorts of bells, bugs and whistles can be found <a href="/oldie/emu.html">here</a><br>
In due time there will be direct links from the code in the lessons but I’m lazy so not yet.</p>
