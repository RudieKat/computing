Reference Manual 



Distribution No.l 



This is the first in a series of distributions of material which, when complete, will 
constitute the reference manual for the ULTRA-16 System. Each distribution will 
contain pages to be inserted into a loose-leaf binder, and may consist of basic 
material for one or more of the sections of the manual and/or replacement pages 
which correct previously published material. In addition, each distribution will 
contain a list of current pages of the manual, a list of the form numbers of all 
previous distributions, and, if necessary because of new included sections or 
extensive changes, an updated table of contents. 

A three-ring loose-leaf binder, the Reference Manual will be supplied to ULTRA-16
installations to hold the pages issued in these distributions. A set of index tabs 
will also be provided with the binder to facilitate reference to a particular part
of the system. The set of tabs will be printed with titles and section numbers of 
the various parts of the system, as follows: 



01 


Introduction 


02 


ULTIMA Language 


03 


Assembler 



04 


Debugging System 


05 


System I/O 


06 


Graphics 


07 


Cryptographic functions 


08 


Programming and Operating Notes 


09 


Glossary 


10 


Appendices 


11 


Index 



This, then, will be the arrangement of the manual. In connection with the above 
outline of the ULTRA-16 reference manual, it should be noted that Section 7, 
Cryptographic functions, will not be included in the documentation supplied
to all locations for security reasons. Please also note that the enclosure is
tamper proof, any attempt at accessing the physical hardware will result in
the complete destruction of the system. 
Programming 
and Operating Notes, was included as a means whereby programming techniques, 
operating methods, etc. , which have been found useful by one user of SOS, could be 
conveniently included in this manual and thereby communicated to the other users 
of the system. Material of this sort, which is intended for inclusion in the manual, 
should be addressed to:

It is also anticipated that a companion manual, the ULTRA-16 General 
Information Manual, will be published in the future. That manual will approach 
the system on a more basic level and will be intended primarily for persons who are 
unacquainted with the ULTRA series. 

In order to facilitate updating of the manual, all pages will specify the distribution 
number and will include a date, consisting of the month and year published, and a 
page number. All page numbers, except those for the appendices, will be six digits 
separated into three groups of two digits by a decimal point. The first two digits 
will be the section number, the next two digits the chapter number within that 
section, and the last two digits will be the number of the page within the chapter. 
For example, 05. 02. 04 will be the number of the fourth page of the second chapter 
in the System I/O Section (05). The page numbers of the appendices will be 
eight digits long. The first two will be 12 (the section number of the appendices), 
the next three groups of two digits will be (in order), appendix number, chapter 
number, and page number.
