SYNOPSIS           roff [ +number ] [ --number ] name1 ...

DESCRIPTION        roff formats text according to control lines embedded in
                   the text. The optional argument "+number" causes printing
                   to begin at the first page with the appropriate number; --
                   number causes printing to cease at the first page with a
                   higher number.

                   roff is fully described in a separate publication
                   [reference].
